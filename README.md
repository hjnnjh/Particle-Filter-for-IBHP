# IBHP

- This repository provides simulation and the parameter estimator based on Sequential Monte Carlo(SMC) for IBHP.
- Paper: [***The Indian Buffet Hawkes Process to Model Evolving Latent Influences***](http://auai.org/uai2018/proceedings/papers/289.pdf).
- **Pyro** realization(Accelerated by PyTorch) is coming soon.

## Simulation for IBHP

- We simulate IBHP base on the algorithm proposed in [Ogata (1981)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1056305).
- The simulation aigorithm is in `IBHP_sim.py`.
